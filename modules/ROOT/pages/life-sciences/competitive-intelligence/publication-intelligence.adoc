= Publication Intelligence

Scientific publications reveal competitive research directions years before patents or clinical trials appear. By connecting publications with authors, institutions, genes, diseases, and clinical variants from databases like http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/[ClinVar], companies can identify emerging therapeutic targets, track institutional expertise, and discover collaboration opportunities. This intelligence becomes particularly valuable in pharma and biotech, where publications often signal strategic intent years before clinical data or product launches, allowing companies to anticipate competitive dynamics in specific therapeutic areas and adjust their development priorities accordingly.

== Scenario

A pharma Competitive Intelligence team monitoring Alzheimer's research faces information overload—thousands of disconnected https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/[PubMed] results make it impossible to answer strategic questions like: "Which institutions are leading TREM2 research?" or "What new gene-disease links are validated by clinical evidence?" They need to connect these publications to patents, clinical trials, and other research to understand the competitive landscape and identify potential collaboration opportunities.

== Solution

The graph connects publications, authors, institutions, genes, proteins, diseases and SNPs in a unified model. This enables traversing complex paths like "Institution, Author, Publication, Gene, Clinical Variant, Disease" in single queries, revealing patterns invisible in traditional databases.

Publication-based competitive intelligence (CI) can be powerfully connected to patent-based CI by leveraging overlapping entities within both datasets. Scientific publications often provide the foundational knowledge that patents build upon, with many patents explicitly citing key publications during the patent application process. Entities such as genes, drug targets, and molecular variants commonly appear in both scholarly articles and patent claims, allowing for the mapping of innovation trajectories from basic research to intellectual property. Furthermore, authors of high-impact publications may also appear as inventors or advisors in patents, making them key opinion leaders and potential collaboration partners. Integrating publication and patent CI enables organizations to identify emerging hot spots, influential contributors, and the translation of novel scientific discoveries into protectable inventions.
