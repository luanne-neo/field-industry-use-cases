= Competitive Intelligence

Competitive intelligence is the process of gathering, analysing, and using information to gain a competitive advantage. It is a key part of business intelligence and is used to make informed decisions about market trends and customer needs.

Competitive intelligence in the life sciences domain can comes from some Key sources:

* Publicly available information about company drug pipelines 
* Scientific publications
* Patent filings 

Integrating insights from these data streams enables organizations to monitor competitor activity, identify emerging trends, and make better-informed strategic decisions.

Together, pipeline, publication and patent intelligence each offer a unique graph view of the competitive landscape. By merging these graphs into a unified knowledge graph, organizations can connect patents, published research, and drug pipeline activity into a single, integrated source of truth—enabling advanced queries, richer insights, and a holistic perspective on life sciences innovation and competition.
