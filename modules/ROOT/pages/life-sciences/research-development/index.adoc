https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics[Omics] data represents one of the most transformative yet challenging frontiers in life sciences research. 
Encompassing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics[genomics], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptomics_technologies[transcriptomics], 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics[proteomics], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolomics[metabolomics], and other high-throughput 
molecular measurements, omics technologies generate unprecedented volumes of data about biological systems.

The true power of omics data emerges not from individual datasets in isolation, but from their integration. Connecting genomic variants 
to transcript abundance, linking protein expression patterns to metabolic profiles, and mapping these relationships across different biological 
contexts reveals the complex molecular mechanisms underlying health and disease. *However, this integration presents substantial data management challenges*.
Omics datasets vary dramatically in structure, scale, and standardization—from the linear sequences of 
genomics to the multidimensional matrices of metabolomics.

Effective omics data management requires *flexible data models*, robust infrastructure for storage, annotation, and retrieval, along with 
standardized vocabularies and identifiers that bridge different data types. Critically, connecting experimental omics measurements to 
well-characterized biomedical entities like genes, proteins, pathways, and phenotypes—transforms raw data into biological insight. Graph-based 
approaches have emerged as particularly valuable for representing these interconnected relationships, enabling researchers to traverse from a
genomic variant through its transcriptional effects and protein consequences to ultimately understand its impact on cellular function and 
disease phenotypes. This systems-level view, powered by integrated omics data, is reshaping drug discovery, precision medicine, and our 
fundamental understanding of biology.

== Use Cases

The use cases below illustrate how omics data integration can drive insights in life sciences research and development.

=== xref:life-sciences/research-development/single-omics.adoc[Single-omics Data Integration]

Single-omics data integration focuses on combining datasets within a single omics domain, such as genomics or proteomics.

=== xref:life-sciences/research-development/multi-omics.adoc[Multi-omics Data Integration]

Multi-omics data integration involves combining datasets from multiple omics domains to provide a more comprehensive view of biological systems.
